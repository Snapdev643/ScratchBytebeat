# ScratchBytebeat

My first thing on github + scratch/turbowarp extension.

## Make bytebeats in scratch!

No custom variables & only normal C and simple JS bytebeats (for now).

Adds 2 blocks:
* Generate a Bytebeat with [FORMULA] at [SAMPLE_RATE] Hz for [DURATION] seconds,
* Stop Playback

And 1 bool: Is Sound Playing?

### More to come!
